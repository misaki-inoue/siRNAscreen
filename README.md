# siRNAscreen

"siRNA_screen_scripts" contains 5 different R scripts to obtain z-scores and visualize the screen results. 
The raw luminescence readings are saved as text files in a subdirectory "datafiles".

"siRNA_screen_validation_scripts" has identical setup as "siRNA_screen_scripts".
However, this is used for the analysis of validation experiments of the top two hits indentified in the siRNA screen.
The raw luminescence readings are recorded after treating cells inside 384 well plates with two types of individual siRNAs.
